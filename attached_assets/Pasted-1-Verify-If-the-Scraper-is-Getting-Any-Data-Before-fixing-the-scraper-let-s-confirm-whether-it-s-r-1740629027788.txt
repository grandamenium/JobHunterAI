1. Verify If the Scraper is Getting Any Data
Before fixing the scraper, let's confirm whether it's receiving HTML content from Indeed or other sites. Add this to the script:

python
Copy
Edit
import requests

url = "https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=neuroscience&l=Yale+Medical+School"
headers = {"User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/121.0.0.0 Safari/537.36"}

response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

# Print the first 1000 characters of the response HTML
print("Response Status:", response.status_code)
print("HTML Content Preview:", response.text[:1000])
âœ… If the status code is 403, youâ€™re being blockedâ€”switch to Selenium.
âœ… If itâ€™s 200 but the content doesnâ€™t contain job listings, the page structure might have changed.

2. If Indeed is Blocking Requests, Use Selenium
Indeed and many job boards block scrapers. Instead of requests, try Selenium:

python
Copy
Edit
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service
from webdriver_manager.chrome import ChromeDriverManager

# Set up Selenium WebDriver
options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()
options.add_argument("--headless")  # Run in headless mode (no browser pop-up)
driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=Service(ChromeDriverManager().install()), options=options)

# Open Indeed job search page
url = "https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=neuroscience&l=Yale+Medical+School"
driver.get(url)

# Wait and extract job listings
job_elements = driver.find_elements(By.CLASS_NAME, "job_seen_beacon")

for job in job_elements:
    print(job.text)  # Print job titles

driver.quit()
ðŸ”¹ If this works, replace BeautifulSoup with Selenium for Indeed.

3. Expand Scraping Beyond Indeed
If Indeed is still failing, use multiple sources:

Yale Medical School Careers: "https://medicine.yale.edu/education/careers/"
Google Jobs: "https://www.google.com/search?q=neuroscience+jobs+at+Yale+Medical+School"
LinkedIn: "https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?keywords=neuroscience&location=Yale%20Medical%20School"
Hereâ€™s a simple scraper for university job boards:

python
Copy
Edit
uni_url = "https://medicine.yale.edu/education/careers/"
uni_response = requests.get(uni_url, headers=headers)

print("University Job Page HTML Preview:", uni_response.text[:1000])
Final Steps
âœ… Test the HTML response (Is Indeed blocking? Is the structure different?)
âœ… Switch to Selenium if dynamic content is loading.
âœ… Use multiple sources (Google Jobs, LinkedIn, University sites).
Try running this and tell me what you get! ðŸš€
