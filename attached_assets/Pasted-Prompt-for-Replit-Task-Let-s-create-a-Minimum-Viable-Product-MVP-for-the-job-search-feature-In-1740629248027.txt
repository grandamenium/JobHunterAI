Task:
Let's create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the job search feature. Instead of scraping real job listings, we will:

Generate 10 diverse example jobs and store them in a local database as objects.
Modify the job search function to query this local database for jobs that match the user's search keywords.
Return relevant job listings based on keyword matching.
Implementation Steps:
Define a Job Model in the database (SQLite for simplicity).
Prepopulate the database with 10 different job listings.
Modify the job search to filter jobs by keyword in the title or description.
Return matching job listings when a user searches.
Code to Implement:
1. Define the Job Model & Database Setup
python
Copy
Edit
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///jobs.db'  # Using SQLite for MVP
db = SQLAlchemy(app)

class Job(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    title = db.Column(db.String(200), nullable=False)
    company = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False)
    location = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False)
    description = db.Column(db.Text, nullable=False)

# Create the database
with app.app_context():
    db.create_all()
2. Populate the Database with 10 Sample Jobs
python
Copy
Edit
def seed_database():
    example_jobs = [
        Job(title="Neuroscience Researcher", company="Yale Medical School", location="New Haven, CT", description="Conduct brain imaging studies on cognitive function."),
        Job(title="AI Engineer", company="Google", location="New York, NY", description="Develop machine learning models for natural language processing."),
        Job(title="Data Scientist", company="Meta", location="San Francisco, CA", description="Analyze social media trends using big data."),
        Job(title="Clinical Trial Coordinator", company="Pfizer", location="Boston, MA", description="Manage neuroscience-related clinical trials."),
        Job(title="Software Engineer", company="Microsoft", location="Seattle, WA", description="Develop backend services for cloud applications."),
        Job(title="Biomedical Engineer", company="Johnson & Johnson", location="Los Angeles, CA", description="Design medical devices for neurological disorders."),
        Job(title="Lab Technician", company="Harvard Medical School", location="Boston, MA", description="Perform lab tests and assist with neuroscience experiments."),
        Job(title="Psychology Professor", company="Stanford University", location="Stanford, CA", description="Teach cognitive neuroscience courses."),
        Job(title="Healthcare Consultant", company="McKinsey & Co.", location="Chicago, IL", description="Advise hospitals on implementing AI-based healthcare solutions."),
        Job(title="UX Researcher", company="Apple", location="Cupertino, CA", description="Study user interactions to improve accessibility for people with neurological conditions."),
    ]

    db.session.bulk_save_objects(example_jobs)
    db.session.commit()

# Run this once to populate the database
with app.app_context():
    seed_database()
3. Implement Search Functionality
python
Copy
Edit
@app.route('/search_jobs', methods=['GET'])
def search_jobs():
    keyword = request.args.get('keyword', '').lower()
    location = request.args.get('location', '').lower()

    # Query the database for matching jobs
    matching_jobs = Job.query.filter(
        (Job.title.ilike(f"%{keyword}%")) | 
        (Job.description.ilike(f"%{keyword}%")),
        Job.location.ilike(f"%{location}%")
    ).all()

    # Convert job results to JSON format
    job_results = [{
        "title": job.title,
        "company": job.company,
        "location": job.location,
        "description": job.description
    } for job in matching_jobs]

    return jsonify(job_results)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
Expected Behavior
âœ… Stores 10 example job listings in a local SQLite database.
âœ… Searches jobs by keyword in the title and description.
âœ… Filters results by user-input location.
âœ… Returns JSON response of matching jobs.

Next Steps
Once this works, we can later replace the dummy database with real job scraping or an external API integration for real-time job listings.
