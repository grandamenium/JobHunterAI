This should give clear instructions for debugging and improving the scraper on Replit. ðŸš€ Let me know if you want me to refine it further!

we still see no jobs found from the interface

It sounds like the scraper isn't retrieving results properly. Let's debug and enhance it. Hereâ€™s what you can do:

1. Check If Indeed is Blocking the Scraper
Some websites block automated requests. Try changing the User-Agent in headers:
python
Copy
Edit
headers = {
    "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/121.0.0.0 Safari/537.36"
}
If itâ€™s still blocked, try using fake_useragent to rotate headers:
python
Copy
Edit
from fake_useragent import UserAgent
headers = {"User-Agent": UserAgent().random}
2. Verify If Indeed Uses JavaScript to Load Jobs
If jobs load dynamically, use Selenium instead of BeautifulSoup. Example:
python
Copy
Edit
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By

options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()
options.add_argument("--headless")  # Run without opening browser
driver = webdriver.Chrome(options=options)

driver.get("https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=neuroscience&l=Yale+Medical+School")
job_elements = driver.find_elements(By.CLASS_NAME, "job_seen_beacon")

for job in job_elements:
    print(job.text)

driver.quit()
3. Expand to Other Job Boards (LinkedIn, University Sites)
Use Selenium or Scrapy to scrape other sources.
Example for Yale Medical Schoolâ€™s career page:
python
Copy
Edit
requests.get("https://medicine.yale.edu/education/careers/")
4. Log Errors and Responses
Before assuming "No jobs found," log the actual response:

python
Copy
Edit
print("Response Status Code:", response.status_code)
print("Response Text:", response.text[:500])  # Print first 500 chars
This will tell if weâ€™re getting blocked or if the structure changed.

Immediate Fixes to Try:
âœ… Change the User-Agent.
âœ… Check if JavaScript is requiredâ€”if yes, switch to Selenium.
âœ… Try logging response HTML to debug.
âœ… Scrape multiple job sources.

Try these and let me know what the response says! ðŸš€
